<h2 class="hd1">CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>LITTLE WHITE FOX MAKES A DISCOVERY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Little White Fox</span> was very, very
much worried, for something dreadful
had happened, something he couldn't
account for at all: Tdariuk, the reindeer,
was dead!</p>

<p>Tdariuk was not related to Little
White Fox. And he wasn't a bit in the
world like him. He was many times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
bigger than Little White Fox would
ever be, and he was quite different
from him in every way. But all the
same, Little White Fox loved him. If
you had asked him why he loved the
big reindeer, he would probably have
told you that, for one thing, Tdariuk,
in spite of his huge body, was very
gentle and kind. None of the little
animals of the tundra was afraid of
him. Little Mrs. Ptarmigan calmly
hunted for dry blueberries and weed
seed right beside him while he cropped
his moss. And when he drew close to
the shore by the sea, Little Brown Seal
never thought of such a thing as slipping
off his rock and hiding in the
water. Even if there were no other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
reason, wouldn't Tdariuk's gentleness alone
make Little White Fox love him?</p>

<p>Now when Little White Fox discovered
that his big, kind friend was dead,
he ran home as fast as his legs could
carry him to tell his mother the sad
news.</p>

<p>"Mother! Mother!" he called tumbling
into his home under the great rock,
"Tdariuk is dead!"</p>

<p>"Tdariuk dead!" cried Madam White
Fox. "Who could have been mean enough
to kill him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know who killed him, but he's
dead, I know that," said Little White Fox,
the tears running down his cheeks.</p>

<p>"It must have been Old Man Gray
Wolf, or Omnok, the hunter," said Madam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
White Fox, wiping her eyes with her paw.
"For my part, I could easily wish them both
dead themselves. None of us is safe as
long as they are about. But who told you
Tdariuk was dead?"</p>

<p>"No one told me. I found it out for myself,"
boasted Little White Fox proudly,
quite forgetting his sorrow in thinking
what a wise young chap he was.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> found it out!" exclaimed his mother.
"Pray, tell me how?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see," explained Little White
Fox, with an air of deep mystery, "I was
down on the tundra, at the foot of Saw
Tooth Mountain, looking all around to see
what I could see. And all of a sudden I
came right on one of Tdariuk's great, fine
antlers lying there in the snow. Now, what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
do you think of that? And when I went on
a little farther, there was the other one!
And then I knew, of course, that Tdariuk
was dead."</p>

<p>When Madam White Fox heard that, she
smiled a little and stopped wiping her eyes.
But all she said was: "Keep your eyes wide
open, my son, and one of these days you will
see something very strange."</p>

<p>Little White Fox thought that a queer way
to answer him. Why, she hadn't even told
him he was smart to discover about Tdariuk.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, mother? What will
I see? Tell me what I will see! <i>Please</i> tell
me what I will see!" teased Little White
Fox.</p>

<p>But not another word would Madam
Fox tell him. Little White Fox wondered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
why she dried her tears for Tdariuk so
quickly, but he couldn't find that out, either.</p>

<p>And so every day and all day, Little White
Fox went peering curiously about everywhere,
just as his mother had told him to do,
trying to find the something that was
"very strange." He looked all around
among the sand dunes by the ocean, but
there was nothing strange there. He went
in and out among the big rocks at the foot
of Saw Tooth Mountain and came near
falling into one of Omnok's cruel traps, but
there was nothing strange there. He went
here and there, and back and forth, all over
the tundra, but there was nothing strange
there.</p>

<p>Hunt as he would, Little White Fox
could find nothing strange anywhere. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
had grown quite discouraged, when one
day, when he was searching down among
the scrub willows by the river, his ear caught
a familiar sound, "Ark! Ark! Ark!"</p>

<p>Little White Fox couldn't believe his ears.</p>

<p>"Why, that's queer!" he exclaimed. "It
sounds just like Tdariuk, the reindeer.
But it can't be Tdariuk. How could it be
Tdariuk, when Tdariuk's dead?"</p>

<p>Then he heard it again, much louder this
time and quite close: "Ark! Ark! Ark!"</p>

<p>Little White Fox, for once in his life,
was too astonished to say a word. He just
held his breath and waited. And in just
another moment out walked Tdariuk, as
big and gentle as ever, and very much alive
indeed. And&mdash;on his head he wore a brand
new pair of antlers, bigger than the others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and all covered with velvet! My! how
handsome those antlers were!</p>

<p>Little White Fox didn't stop to ask a
single question. He just gave Tdariuk one
long look and then whirled around and ran
home as fast as he could travel.</p>

<p>He burst breathlessly into the cave and
started to tell his mother that Tdariuk
wasn't dead. But it wasn't news to her;
she had known it all the time. Little White
Fox, however, had found out the something
very strange that she had hoped he would
find, and had done it all by himself. Therefore
Madam Fox was very happy as she
curled down on the floor for her afternoon
nap.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>LITTLE MISS PTARMIGAN FOOLS HIM</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Little White Fox saw that he had
really found out about Tdariuk, the reindeer,
all by himself, he became very wise. The
next time one of his friends disappeared
from the tundra, he didn't say a word about
it to his mother, but went searching, searching,
everywhere, every day.</p>

<p>This time it was Little Miss Ptarmigan
who had disappeared. Probably you don't
know Miss Ptarmigan, for she lives only
in cold lands where there is plenty of snow.
But she is a very interesting young person.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
She is a bit larger than Madam Partridge
and not quite so large as Madam Prairie
Hen. And a very dainty little lady she is,
too, for all winter&mdash;and that's just the time
Little White Fox had known her&mdash;she had
worn a perfectly white gown, quite as white
as the coat he wore himself. And if she
hadn't worn pink shoes and stockings, he
probably would never have been able to find
her in the snow at all.</p>

<p>Now, if Little White Fox had been as old
as his mother, he would have been trying
all the time to catch Little Miss Ptarmigan
and carry her off to his home for mincemeat.
That is what grown-up foxes do to the Ptarmigan
folks when they get a chance. But
Little White Fox was a very small chap, and
didn't give much thought to mincemeat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
All he thought about was having a good time,
so almost every day he hunted up Miss
Ptarmigan, and they had a grand game of
hide and seek. It was always an exciting
game, too, on account of Miss Ptarmigan's
white dress, and the only way Little White
Fox could find her was by watching for her
pink shoes and stockings as she hid away
in a snow bank. And when she sat on her
feet, he could almost never find her at all.</p>

<p>"You just wait, Miss," cried Little White
Fox one day. "When summer comes, I'll
get you!"</p>

<p>"You will, will you!" replied Miss Ptarmigan.
"How will you do it?"</p>

<p>"Why, in the summer the snow will be
gone, and the ground will be all brown.
Then I will be able to find you anywhere!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Little White Fox gave a hop, skip and jump
that ended in a somersault, so tickled was he
with his own smartness.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" said Miss Ptarmigan, looking
very wise and mysterious.</p>

<p>That was all she said, but Little White
Fox wasn't fussed. He hadn't lain curled
up on the grass mat in his home thinking
about it night after night for nothing.</p>

<p>One day when the snow was nearly all
gone, Little Miss Ptarmigan suddenly disappeared.
Little White Fox didn't believe
she was dead. He remembered how he had
been fooled by Tdariuk, and he remembered,
too, how she had looked when he talked
about catching her. Also, he remembered
how he had found out the truth about
Tdariuk. Therefore, being a wise youngster,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
as I have said, he didn't say a word about it
to his mother. He just went quietly about,
looking, looking everywhere for Miss Ptarmigan.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Miss Ptarmigan had
been making trouble for herself. Silly old
Mrs. White Owl had been telling her all
winter how very well white suited her complexion.
And now summer had come, and
Mother Ptarmigan had forbidden her to go
outdoors at all till her new brown summer
suit was finished. Miss Ptarmigan hated
indoors, and she couldn't understand what
difference her dress made, anyway. But
she never thought of disobeying till one fine,
warm day when her mother was away from
home, Little Miss Ptarmigan grew very
lonesome.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want to go out in the sunshine," she
kept saying to herself. "There can't be a
bit of harm in it. I am sure I would see
Old Mrs. White Owl, and she would say
something nice about my white dress."</p>

<p>Down at the foot of the mountain was
some one else, a some one who didn't
think much about the sunshine and the
flowers. It was Master Black Fox. He
was thinking of his sausage grinder. It
hadn't been used much of late, and he was
afraid it might get lazy. "A plump chub
of a Ptarmigan would grind nicely," he said
to himself, smacking his lips, "but they all
wear brown dresses these days, and one
cannot tell them from the weeds and grass."</p>

<p>Just then his eyes opened wide. "Can I
believe it?" he whispered. "Is that one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
them going down the mountain this minute&mdash;and
with a white dress on? Yes, sir, it
is!"</p>

<p>Then Mr. Fox looked all about him very
sharply, this way and that, for his own
coat was black as coal, and could be seen
quite well against the brown grass when he
moved. But when he lay quite still, you
couldn't tell him from a stone. He was not
afraid that Little Miss Ptarmigan would see
him. He knew where she was, and could
hide behind rocks until he came close to
her.</p>

<p>After Mr. Fox had looked all about him
very sharply, this way and that, he began
to creep around this rock and that one, all
the time drawing closer to innocent, foolish
Little Miss Ptarmigan, whose white dress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
showed plain as day against the brown
earth. And presently he was right behind
a big rock she must pass in just another
minute. And then he was so close that it
seemed almost as if she could hear him
breathe.</p>

<p>But she didn't. She just walked along,
thinking about the fine things Madam White
Owl had said to her, till zing! something
sprang at her. She gave a frightened scream
and flew to one side, but she was too late.
Something sharp and cruel closed down on
the toe of her pink shoes. It was the teeth
of Mr. Black Fox's sausage grinder. But he
closed them down a little too hard, for it cut
the toe right off the pink shoe, and the tips
of Little Miss Ptarmigan's pink toes besides,
and away she flew, screaming with pain,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
toward a white snow bank in the valley.
There each little hurt toe left a red spot
on the white snow, and my, how they did
ache!</p>

<p>One day quite a while later, when Little
White Fox was over among the brown rocks
at the foot of Saw Tooth Mountain, he heard
a scratch, scratch! among the dry grasses
behind him. He turned around, and there
stood a little stranger dressed all in brown.
She looked wonderfully like Miss Ptarmigan.
She was just about the same size, and her
shoes and stockings were just the same shade
of pink.</p>

<p>"Hello, Little White Fox!" she cried.
"I thought you said you could find me when
summer came and the ground was all brown.
You have been looking for me a whole week,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and I have been out here all the time. You
saw me yesterday, but you didn't know me,
because I had put on my summer clothes.
Oh, Little White Fox, you are a very wise
fellow! A very wise fellow, indeed!"</p>

<p>It was Miss Ptarmigan. She had changed
her white gown for a brown one!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>HE GETS HIS HEAD THUMPED</h3>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Who</span> put all those rocks there, I
wonder?" mused Little White Fox, scratching
his head and looking puzzled. "They are
white and all the same size. How queer!"</p>

<p>Little White Fox had climbed almost to
the top of Cape Prince of Wales Mountain.
He had crept around among the rocks until
he was way out on a ledge looking out over
the great blue sea. And here he had found
these strange rocks, all gathered in one little
pile by themselves. As he looked around,
he presently saw more piles here and there,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and all just the same size. "Now, what do
you think of that!" he said to himself,
scratching his head again, and more puzzled
than ever.</p>

<p>He was still rubbing his head thoughtfully,
when a sound behind him made him
look around, and his bright eyes fell on a
group of the strangest little people any small
fox ever came across. There were seven
of them. They all stood in a row, and each
was as straight up and down as the big
whalebone over the grave Omnok, the hunter,
had made for his father. Little White
Fox had seen some of these strange folks
when he was with his mother a few days
before. She had told him that they belonged
to the Sea Parrot family. "There is a very
large family of them," she had said. "They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
live almost anywhere on the ocean most of
the year, but they make Alaska their summer
home."</p>

<p>These seven little black sea parrots all
stood up stiffly in a row, and not one word
did they say, either to Little White Fox
or to one another. But Little White Fox
felt that they were looking at him, and he
didn't like it a bit. "What business is it
of theirs if I walk around here and see what
I can see?" he thought to himself. "They
are very ugly little people, anyway. Look
at their faces! They are nearly all nose!
And such ugly, bent noses I never saw before
in all my life, either!"</p>

<p>Just then a strange, pleasing smell came
to Little White Fox's quivering nostrils.
Could it come from those strange, round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
rocks? He would see. He walked up to
one of the piles, and, putting his nose down
close, gave a big, long sniff. Yes, sir, that's
just where it did come from! "How queer!"
thought he. "I never saw such rocks before.
Guess I'll push one of them around and
see what will happen." At that, he stretched
out one of his front paws, and began to roll
one of the rocks about. Bing! something
struck him an awful blow right on the top of
his head.</p>

<p>"Ouch! What was that!" cried Little
White Fox, peering about and rubbing his
head.</p>

<p>The seven strangers were standing still
stiff in a straight row. Not a word did they
say, but they had moved quite a bit closer to
Little White Fox.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder," said Little White Fox. Then
he began to roll the rock again. Bing!
something struck his head, harder than
before. Little White Fox whirled about
quickly this time. One of the strangers
was straightening up.</p>

<p>"What has she been doing?" he said to
himself. "I shouldn't wonder if she had
been hitting me with her ugly face. I
have a great mind to bite her! What business
is it of hers if I come up here and roll
these little stones around? Don't all the
stones in the world belong to anybody who
wants them?"</p>

<p>He gave the rock a vigorous push this
time. It rolled over a small ledge, gave a
little squash! and broke in two in the
middle. Little White Fox could hardly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
believe his eyes when he saw the inside of
the stone spread out on the ground, all
yellow and white! And <i>Ah-ne-ca!</i> how
strong it smelled! But the smell was the
most delicious that Little White Fox had
ever sniffed.</p>

<p>"I'll just taste some of that good smelling
stuff," said Little White Fox happily, and
was about to poke his small nose right into
it, when ouch! something hit him a terrible
whack right on the top of his head. My,
how it hurt! It made his head ache so he
could hardly think straight. And this time
he knew who had done it. It was one of
those ugly Parrot people.</p>

<p>"Now, I <i>will</i> bite her!" cried Little White
Fox, and straight at that stiff row he dashed.
And then at last the strangers found their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
tongues. Such a screaming and chattering
Little White Fox had never heard before.
But he found he couldn't bite them, after
all, for every time he jumped at one of them,
she leaped right over his head and hit him
with her ugly face. So by and by Little
White Fox was glad to run away home and
leave the strange rocks to the ugly little
people who were so savage and so bold.</p>

<p>Mother White Fox laughed and laughed
when she heard of her son's strange adventure.</p>

<p>"But, mother," said Little White Fox,
looking very much puzzled, "What did
they care about those old rocks?"</p>

<p>"Care, child!" cried his mother, holding
her sides, "those things were not rocks; they
were their eggs. And the ledge you were on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
was their home. By and by those eggs will
turn into little Sea Parrots, and when their
wings and feet are strong, the babies will go
swimming and flying out over the shining
sea."</p>

<p>Little White Fox was far too young to
understand all this, but he could understand
how his head had been thumped. So you
may be sure it was a long, long time before
he went back to that cliff. When he did so,
the Sea Parrots were all gone, and so were
the strange things he had thought were
rocks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>WHEN LITTLE FOXES QUARREL</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> apparently were more little Foxes
together on the tundra that afternoon
than there ever had been before. Little
White Fox had just come around a bunch
of muckluck grass and spied them, all very
much interested in something they had found.</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha!" chuckled Little White Fox
to himself. "They'll get their heads pecked
good and hard pretty soon!" For those
little Foxes there on the tundra had found
some of those same round objects that Little
White Fox had thought were stones and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
later learned were eggs. The only difference
was that these were much larger and
were out on the tundra near one of the salt
ponds.</p>

<p>The young Foxes had been playing happily
together when they found the eggs. There
were the Silver Fox twins, the Black Fox
triplets, Reynard Red Fox, Violet Blue Fox,
and Baby Cross Fox. Rather a large gathering
of Foxes, I admit, but there are more of
the Fox family in Alaska than in any other
part of the world.</p>

<p>Little White Fox slipped behind the
muckluck grass and listened. His relatives
were quarrelling over who should have the
extra egg. You see here were eight little
Foxes and nine eggs, so the question was
who should take the extra egg?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"We should have the egg," said the Silver
Fox twins boastfully, "because we belong
to the most aristocratic branch of the family.
Our mother's coat alone is worth three hundred
dollars."</p>

<p>"You have no more right to hold up your
heads than we have," one of the Black Fox
triplets answered him. "Our mother's coat
is worth quite as much as any Silver Fox's
that ever lived."</p>

<p>"Fie! Fie! you are both wrong," reproved
Reynard Red Fox. "The best known
should always be considered first. Now
my father is known all over the world.
Whole books have been written about our
family."</p>

<p>"I should have it, because I am a baby,"
wailed Baby Cross Fox.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd like to see any of you get it," cried
Violet Blue Fox, seizing the egg and attempting
to carry it away. But the
greedy miss, while trying to carry it, let
go of the one she already had, so she was
not a whit ahead.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter was that one of those
eggs was all any little Fox could carry, and
it certainly was all he could possibly eat.
But of course not one of them had thought
about that.</p>

<p>Now Little White Fox had lain hid behind
the muckluck grass nearly splitting himself
with laughter at the thought of the whacking
their heads were going to get after awhile.
But when he had waited a long time and
no one had come to molest his cousins, he
began to want one of those eggs for himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
It happened that this was the nest of Old
Mrs. Long Neck, the widgeon duck. And
Omnok, the hunter, had captured her two
days before, so she would never come back
to protect her eggs.</p>

<p>Little White Fox stood it as long as he
could, and then he came marching boldly
out from his hiding place.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind," he said very importantly,
"I'll take the extra egg, and that
will settle the difficulty."</p>

<p>But that only started the discussion going
faster than ever. "You didn't!" "I did!"
"You can't!" "I can!" "I will!" "You
won't!" and so on and so on they went.
Probably they would be quarrelling yet, if
Little White Fox had not caught sight of a
very tall person coming through the muckluck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
grass. It was the dreadful Omnok,
the hunter!</p>

<p>"Look out!" he cried.</p>

<p>But he was too late. Bang! went the
hunter's terrible gun, and a hot bullet
whizzed by his ear. The Foxes scattered
in every direction, Little White Fox making
for his home as fast as his legs would carry
him. And his heart beat so fast that even
when he had been for half an hour safe
under the big flat rock, his breath still came
pantingly.</p>

<p>"<i>Ah-ne-ca!</i>" cried Omnok, out on the
tundra. "What did I shoot at them for?
Their coats are not worth a penny till old
winter gets at them and makes them thick
and strong. My, but they were a fine
bunch! If I can catch half of them next<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
winter, I can buy a whole herd of reindeer
and become a reindeer man. But what have
we here? Ho-ho! So this is what they
were making such a fuss about! Old Long
Neck's nest! Well, I guess nine good eggs
will be fine eating for my wife and the children."</p>

<p>With that Omnok put the eggs in his
hunting sack and went stalking away.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>LITTLE WHITE FOX MEETS BARRED
SEAL</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Little White Fox</span> was running all over
the ice that covered the ocean. It was
spring, and the sun was shining its best all
the time, but there was plenty of ice left.
When there is two miles of ice out on the
sand bar, and it is all six feet thick, you may
easily guess it takes the sun a long time to
loosen it up.</p>

<p>Well, Little White Fox was skipping
about here and there to see what he could
see, and was not paying much attention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
where he was going when, <i>Ah-ne-ca!</i> down
he went! Down! Down! and splash!
right into the icy water! My! he was
frightened! How was he ever to get out
of that place? Six feet of ice wall, straight
as the sides of a house, was all about him.
But what was this he saw on one side. It
seemed to be a sort of little shelf. And,
yes sir! as Little White Fox swam over to
that side and began to climb up, his feet
caught on a ledge, and before he knew it he
was sitting in as neat a little room as you
ever saw, and all made out of ice! walls,
floor, and ceiling!</p>

<p>"Now I wonder who lives here," said Little
White Fox to himself. "Whoever it is, I
suppose I shall have a great quarrel with
him when he comes home."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>But no one came, and very soon his coat
was quite dry and he found himself very
comfortable in this strange little ice palace.
But how was he ever to get out and go back
to his mother and friends?</p>

<p>Just when he was thinking about that, he
saw the water get black all at once, and in
another moment he was looking right into
the face of a stranger who had popped up
out of the water, as if by magic.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Little White Fox,
shaking all over with fright.</p>

<p>"I have many names." The stranger
grinned so broadly Little White Fox quite
lost his fear at once. "Some call me Barred
Seal," the stranger continued, "and some
call me Ring Seal. Others call me Rainbow
Seal, and still others call me Northern Lights.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
You may call me what you like. But say,
there's room for us both up there, isn't
there? I am tired!"</p>

<p>"But," said Little White Fox, when they
were both comfortably seated, "you look
very much like Little Brown Seal."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the other, "he is my cousin,
so is Spotted Seal and Oogrook, the big seal,
and Little Light Brown Seal, and goodness
knows how many more! We are a large
family. I am told that we have cousins
living down in the Aleutian Islands who are
very aristocratic indeed. They go by the
name of Hair Seal. Why, their coats, I
am told, are so valuable that Omnok, the
hunter, would risk his life to get one of them!
For my part, I prefer this simple coat
which no man would steal, unless he needed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
it to make a pair of boots. But you must be
hungry, and so am I. Just wait a minute."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 385px;">
<img src="images/003.jpg" width="385" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"Now," he said, when he had finished fishing,
"we will have dinner." <i>Page <a href="#Page_38">38</a></i></div>

<p>Master Barred Seal disappeared in the
water, reappearing from time to time with
a fish in his mouth.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, when he had finished
fishing, "we will have dinner." Before
Little White Fox was spread the most tempting
array of fish he had ever seen.</p>

<p>"This is the finest home in the world,"
said Barred Seal proudly. "Your dinner
comes right to your front door. Look!"</p>

<p>Little White Fox looked, and sure enough,
there in the water were plenty more fish
swimming round and round.</p>

<p>"But what if Omnok, the hunter, should
find us here?" Little White Fox shivered
suddenly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>"What if he should?" repeated the other.
"There are four feet of solid ice between us
and the top. He will not come down in the
water to get us, so what could he do?"</p>

<p>"But very soon, Mother tells me," said
Little White Fox, "the ice will all melt, or
the wind will blow it out to sea."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, in that case," replied Barred
Seal, smiling, "there is still the wild, free
ocean to live in as always."</p>

<p>"Not for me!" said Little White Fox,
turning white in the face and losing his appetite
all at once. "How can I get out of
here?"</p>

<p>"You don't want to go so soon," answered
Barred Seal. "Stay with me awhile. I
rather like you. And, as you see, we have
plenty of good fish to eat."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thank you," said Little White Fox
very politely, "but I'd very much rather
go back home." And at that moment he
had a frightful vision of all that ice going
out, out to sea.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Barred Seal, "I'll go
in the water and stand on my tail; then you
can climb out on my back. Only don't
dig in your toe nails."</p>

<p>In another moment Little White Fox was
out in the bright sunshine, and you may be
very sure he was glad to be there. "I
guess the world was made about right,"
he said to himself. "And I am glad the
hills, the tundra, and my own little home
are just as they are, and I am glad I am
Little White Fox."</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>LITTLE WHITE FOX HELPS HIMSELF</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Little White Fox</span> was hungry again,
and it was the hard, cold, winter time, when
all of the little folks of the tundra have to
hunt far and wide for food. He had asked
Tdariuk, the reindeer, to invite him out to
dinner. Tdariuk was very nice about it, but
said he had only some lichens, which men
call reindeer moss, to eat. When Little
White Fox tasted them, he said they were
not one bit good. The truth is they are
very bitter, and taste good only to Reindeer
and Caribou folks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>So Little White Fox went scratching away
over the tundra and hillsides to see what he
could find. He was half way up the side of
Cape Prince of Wales Mountain when he
came on the tracks of a stranger. "He
must have come down from the higher
mountains," said Little White Fox to himself.
"I wonder who he is. I don't
believe he is any bigger than I am, for his
tracks are very close together."</p>

<p>He followed the tracks, very curious to
know who this newcomer might be. Pretty
soon he came to a tunnel right into the snow.
There were several tracks in and out of
this, so he could not tell whether the
stranger were at home or not. Little White
Fox knew now that the other fellow was not
so large as he, for the tunnel was almost too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
small for him to enter. But he gathered
his coat close around him and crowded in.
He rather hoped that he would not find
the stranger at home, but that the table
would be set for dinner.</p>

<p>And that was just the way it was! Little
White Fox knocked at the door, and when
no one answered, he walked right in. No,&mdash;the
table wasn't set, but in the storeroom
there was plenty of food. Little White Fox
did not make the least fuss but set the table
himself.</p>

<p>Now you might think that Little White
Fox would eat only fresh eggs and fish,
but if you think so you are mistaken. He
likes berries and roots, and that is just
what he had to eat that day,&mdash;blueberries
from the hillsides and nice juicy roots and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
bulbs from the tundra! My, they tasted
good!</p>

<p>He had just finished eating when something
disturbed him. He had been listening
to the noise the wind made blowing
across the entrance to the tunnel. Now
the wind didn't make any more noise,&mdash;not
so he could hear it, anyway. That
meant that some one had entered the tunnel.</p>

<p>Now Little White Fox was not wishing to
see any one just then. "Guess I'd better
find the other door to this house and go
home," he said to himself. But there wasn't
any other door. Little White Fox wasn't
afraid, but then,&mdash;he just humped himself
all up in a corner and wished he didn't
have to meet the stranger, that was all.</p>

<p>Well, sir! he had to laugh when he saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the stranger come in at the door. He was
the oddest little fellow you ever saw! He
looked just like Thunder, the big white
rabbit, only his ears were short, his coat
was yellow, and he was ever so much smaller.
Little White Fox knew who he was right
away, for he had heard his mother speak of
the Lemming family. And this was one of
the Lemmings! There could be no doubt of
it. And the Lemmings are great fighters,
if they happen to be in the mood for it.
Why, they have been known to jump right
into the ocean and try to swim across it.</p>

<p>"Now I wonder what I'd better do,"
thought Little White Fox to himself. But
just because he couldn't think of anything at
all to do, he did nothing. And that was the
very wisest way to behave just then. All<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
bunched up the way he was, he looked very
large and strong. The longer Mr. Lemming
looked at him, the more sure he became that
Little White Fox was some relation of his.
And we must be very kind to all our relatives,
especially when they are bigger than we are!</p>

<p>Mr. Lemming moved over to one side of
the room as if to say, "You may go out if
you like."</p>

<p>Little White Fox moved half way to the
door and then stopped, which meant, "I'd
like you to move a little farther away."</p>

<p>Mr. Lemming went back to the other side.</p>

<p>Little White Fox went to the door, but
even then he did not go out, not right away,
he didn't. He turned and looked at Mr.
Lemming, which meant, "You won't bite
my heels, will you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Lemming didn't make a move.</p>

<p>Little White Fox put his head out of the
door. Then you should have seen him get
out of that tunnel! I don't believe Little
White Fox ever went faster in the world.
When he was out on the snow, he looked
around and felt foolish, for Mr. Lemming
was not coming after him at all.</p>

<p>That night Mr. Lemming closed up the
tunnel to his house and made a new one
under a rock, where he thought Little White
Fox would not be able to find it.</p>

<p>Of course Little White Fox should have
waited until Mr. Lemming came home, and
then asked him for something to eat. But,
you know, he was very hungry, and besides
he was only a little white fox, after all.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>LITTLE WHITE BEAR AND LITTLE
BLACK BEAR</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Little White Bear</span> stepped out from
behind a great boulder that was black as
black could be against the whitest of all
white worlds. And my! It was a lonesome
world! His mother had left him alone,
years and years ago, it seemed to him, to
find something to eat. At last he was so
lonesome he just had to get out into the sunshine
and see if there was any one in all
the wide, white world who would play with
a little white bear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder! I do wonder if there is any
one!" he said to himself.</p>

<p>"Chee! Chee!" said a very small voice
right close to him. He looked and looked,
and at last he spied Little Snow Bunting
balancing herself on a salmon-berry bush.</p>

<p>"What does she mean by that?" thought
Little White Bear. "Does she want to play
with me?" But when he came closer to her,
she said "Chee! Chee!" so loudly and
saucily he felt almost sure she didn't, and
when she spread her snowy wings and flew
far, far away, he was quite sure she didn't.</p>

<p>"My! What a world!" said Little White
Bear. "I wonder&mdash;" But just then he
heard a strange sound,&mdash;crack&mdash;crack&mdash;crackety,
crackety, crack! What could it
be? In just a moment Tdariuk, the reindeer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
came trotting around the point, and
Little White Bear knew it was Tdariuk's
heels he had heard cracking. But Tdariuk
didn't give him time to say a word. He
just caught one whiff of bear smell, and away
he went faster than ever,&mdash;crack&mdash;crack&mdash;crackety,
crackety, crackety! Crack!
Crack!</p>

<p>Down by the ocean things were no better.
When Little Brown Seal saw him coming,
he tumbled right into the ocean without
so much as saying "How do you do."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 415px;">
<img src="images/004.jpg" width="415" height="500" alt="" title="" />
Little White Bear knew right away what he had
done. <i>Page <a href="#Page_52">52</a></i></div>

<p>Little White Bear looked this way and
that, and suddenly he spied some little black
things going up and down, up and down, over
a little snow hill. Sometimes there were
four, sometimes three, sometimes two, and
sometimes none at all. "Must be Jim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Raven and his crowd," said Little White
Bear. "Well, <i>they</i> won't get away from me!
I'll just slip up to that little hill and then
jump right over it so quick they won't
have time to fly away!" He slipped up
very quietly, Oh! just as quietly as any
little bear could. He crept round this little
hill and that little salmon-berry bush until
he was right under the snow hill. "Now,"
he said to himself, "Now's the time!" He
couldn't see the black things going up and
down, but he knew they were there, so he
gave one big, big spring and then, "Oh!
Oh! Ow! Wow! E-e-e! Let me go!" he
cried, and bounded away as fast as he
could. What could have scratched him so?
Where had Jim Raven and his crowd gone?
Pretty soon he looked around, and right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
there in the snow where he had jumped was
a little bear just about his own size and a
great deal like him, but black as black could
be!</p>

<p>"What'd you jump on my stomach for?"
said the stranger. Then Little White Bear
knew right away what he had done. The
black things he thought were Jim Raven and
his crowd were not those people at all, but
they were Little Black Bear's feet sticking
up over the hill, as he rolled around on the
snow, having a frolic all by himself.</p>

<p>"Well," said Little White Bear, "where
did you come from?"</p>

<p>"Oh! My home is just a little way up in
the hills," said Little Black Bear politely.
"We have a great many cousins in this cold
country; there is Little Brown Bear and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Big Barren Ground Grizzly Bear, and I
don't know how many more, but we seldom
get to see any of our white cousins. How
are you? I am glad to see you."</p>

<p>"I think I shall be very fine when I get
over my scratches," smiled Little White
Bear. "You must have very sharp claws."</p>

<p>"They are quite sharp," said Little Black
Bear slowly. "I am sorry I scratched you.
Let's find something to play, and you will
forget all about it."</p>

<p>"All right!" said Little White Bear gleefully,
and away they went, looking for some
adventure in the great, white world.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>TROUBLE FOR LITTLE WHITE BEAR</h3>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Come</span> on," cried Little White Bear, almost
standing on his head in his eagerness
to be at play with this new friend.</p>

<p>"Let's go exploring," said Little Black
Bear. "That's the most fun of all!"</p>

<p>"All right," shouted Little White Bear,
turning a handspring. And away they went,&mdash;two
little bears out to see what they could
find in the great, white world.</p>

<p>They went down by the lakes and saw
where Widgeon had made her nests in the
warm summer time; they wandered over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the hills and said "Woof Woof!" in the
doorway to Little Mrs. White Fox's home;
they went here and there, but at last they
came upon something really very strange.</p>

<p>"What can it be?" said Little White
Bear, standing on one foot and looking
very wise.</p>

<p>"What <i>can</i> it be!" said Little Black Bear,
scratching his head. And what indeed could
it be? It was right down at the foot of the
mountain. There was a big, black, square
thing right in the snow, and in the middle
of that there was another little square that
was brown. Did any one in the wide world
ever hear of finding such a strange thing
in a great white wilderness? There wasn't
a square thing anywhere else on the whole
tundra. Things were round and crooked and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
made of little angles, but who ever saw a
square thing in real tundra land?</p>

<p>The two little Bears walked round and
round it and tried to think what it could
be. At last Little Black Bear put one
foot on it very timidly. "There!" he
said bravely, "I stepped on it! Do you
dare?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do!" said Little White Bear,
walking right out on the big square. "See
me!" he shouted and went racing right
across the thing. That is, he started across,
but just when he was on the little brown
square, he felt his feet begin to sink. There
was a rip&mdash;ripping of something, and down
he went, till he struck kerwhack! on something
far below. He jumped to his feet
very quickly. Where was he? There were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
brown walls all about him, like the walls
of the cave where his home was. And look
as he might, Little White Bear could see
no way to get out except to climb back up
through the hole he had made when he fell
in. And that was far, far above his head.
He could never get out that way. And what
was worst of all, as he began to look around,
he was more and more sure of one dreadful
thing. And that was that he was in the
house of Omnok the hunter. My! That
was a terrible thought. But it was true!
They had been playing on Omnok's roof, and
Little White Bear had fallen right through
the window in the roof. Omnok had made a
curtain out of the coats of many eider ducks,
and this was the brown square that Little
White Bear had started to run across.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, there wasn't a thing he could do.
He just wandered round and round, but he
couldn't find the least little place where he
could get out. "What a strange place to
live!" he thought to himself. "How does
he ever get into it himself?"</p>

<p>But Little White Bear wasn't the least bit
doubtful that Omnok would be able to
get into his house when he came home. And
you may be very sure he wasn't a bit happy.
He just went way over in the corner under
Omnok's bed and sucked his thumb while he
wished he was at home in his own dear cave.
All of a sudden he heard a noise. Omnok
was coming! Little White Bear heard his
voice, very big and very angry, outside!
"Who has stolen my 'pooksack'?" Omnok
growled. "Who has broken my window?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>How poor Little White Bear trembled.
He crouched down under the bed just as
far as he could. Now he could hear Omnok
come closer to his house. And then he
saw Omnok's face at the side of the wall.
Ah! Yes! There was a little curtain there!
Why had he not seen it! But suddenly
a happy thought came to Little White Bear.
Just when Omnok was standing up, with his
terrible gun in his hand, Little White Bear
rushed right at him and tumbled against
his feet so hard that Omnok went sprawling
to the floor, and his terrible gun went clattering
after.</p>

<p>Little White Bear bounded out of the little
door. But there was just a little alley and
then another room with a window high up
in the wall. He looked quickly, and saw a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
little shelf, like Omnok's bed, only higher
up, right under the window! Little White
Bear jumped up but tumbled back. He
tried it again and fell back. But the third
time he found himself on the shelf, and in
another minute he was out in the fine old
world, running as fast as ever he could for
home. And you may be very sure he was
glad to be with his mother safe in their cave
that night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>LITTLE BLACK BEAR'S DISCOVERY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> was Little Black Bear doing all the
time Little White Bear was down in Omnok's
house, and what about Omnok's "pooksack"?
Well, Little Black Bear looked
down into Omnok's house and wished his
little playmate would hurry out, so they
could discover some more things. But when
he had waited what seemed a long, long time,
he went on a little exploring trip all by himself.
And he discovered something right
away. It had four legs like Tdariuk, the
reindeer. But it was ever so much larger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
than Tdariuk, and its legs were straighter.
Little Black Bear wasn't long in finding
out that this was not really any one at all,
but just a rack Omnok had made on which
to keep his meat. And there was meat up
there! Oh! strips and strips of it! But
it was all high out of reach. Little Black
Bear sniffed and sniffed, and My! It did
smell good! But even when he stood on
his tiptoes he couldn't reach the least little
mouthful. There <i>was</i> one thing closer to
the ground. And such a strange thing as
it was! It looked like a coat that had
belonged to one of Little Brown Seal's
cousins, but he couldn't be in the coat right
then, for the collar was tied up tight as could
be, and so were the sleeves.</p>

<p>"If there was any one in that coat, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
would smother right away," said Little
Black Bear, scratching his head. "But
there is something in it! See how its sides
bulge out! I'll just give it a good poke
and see what happens."</p>

<p>Now that strange thing was just hung
up by one string, and it swung about very
easily. When Little Black Bear gave it a
great poke, it went up in the air quickly!
It came down quickly too, and it hit Little
Black Bear square on his nose. He spun
about and tumbled down in the snow, and
at first he had a notion to be angry.</p>

<p>When the thing had stopped swinging, he
stood on his tiptoes and smelled of it.
"E-ee-ee! How good it smells," he cried.
"I just believe that is Omnok's 'pooksack'
of seal oil which mother has been talking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
about!" Little Black Bear's mouth began
to water and water, for his mother had
told him there was nothing half so good in
the world as fine, rich seal oil.</p>

<p>Now how was Little Black Bear going to
get that oil out of that "pooksack"? He
thought and thought and thought. At
last he remembered the sleeves which were
tied up. They were tied way down at the
ends, and there must be seal oil right down
to the very tips. His mouth was too small
to bite the "pooksack", but one of these
sleeves,&mdash;that was the very thing! He
would bite one of those, hard! with his sharp
teeth, and the oil would come right out into
his mouth!</p>

<p>He had to stand on his tiptoes to reach,
but at last he set his teeth hard and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
<i>Ah-ne-ca!</i> How good that seal oil did
taste! It went gurgle, gurgle, right down
his throat so fast he could hardly get time
to swallow.</p>

<p>But very soon he began to feel as if he
had had quite enough. How was he going
to stop the seal oil from coming out? Well,
he couldn't do that. He would just have
to open his mouth and dodge right out of
the way quick. "That will be easy," he
thought to himself. Anyway, he took two
or three more swallows, then he opened his
mouth wide, and <i>Ah-ne-ca!</i> before he could
move one bit, that seal oil shot him right in
the eyes and ears and began to run down his
back so fast he couldn't even give one grunt.
You should have seen that little bear! He
was oil from head to foot! And as for his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
fine, silky, glossy, black coat, he was just sure
it was ruined! He didn't stop a minute to
see if Little White Bear was out of Omnok's
house, but ran home as fast as ever he could.</p>

<p>"Why! Why!" cried his mother, as he
came into the house. "Where have you
been?"</p>

<p>Little Black Bear couldn't say a word.
He just crawled over in one corner and
looked down at his toes.</p>

<p>And was his coat really ruined? Ask
puss if her coat is ruined some day when she
comes in out of the rain, and see what she
will say. Mother Black Bear cleaned that
coat up that very night so it looked better
then new, but how she did it I wouldn't
pretend to say.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>FUN FOR TWO LITTLE BEARS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Little White Bear</span> and Little Black
Bear met at the snow hill next day, but
Little White Bear didn't jump into Little
Black Bear's sharp claws, and you may
be very, very sure they didn't go exploring
around Omnok's house! They did go way,
way out on the white roof of the ocean.
There were splendid hills of ice to hide behind,
and everywhere were great ice boulders
over which they could play leap-frog.</p>

<p>Little White Bear had just started to
leap over one fine, large boulder, and Little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Black Bear was coming right after him,
when all of a sudden Little White Bear turned
a backward somersault and tumbled right
into Little Black Bear.</p>

<p>"Wow!" howled Little Black Bear.
"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Shish!" whispered Little White Bear.
"I saw something!"</p>

<p>"On the ice?" asked Little Black Bear,
beginning to be frightened.</p>

<p>"Right out there a little bit farther,"
whispered Little White Bear. "And it
was the biggest thing! Oh! My! I can't
tell how big it was!" Then Little Black
Bear was frightened! What could it be,
way out here on the ice, miles and miles
from shore? Little White Bear hadn't seen
it move, but how could it get way out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
here if it weren't alive? Trees and things
like that couldn't grow on the roof of the
ocean.</p>

<p>They lay crouched down behind that
big ice boulder until Little White Bear's
foot had gone to sleep, and Little Black
Bear was catching cold from sitting on
the ice.</p>

<p>"I am going to peek round and see if it
has moved," said Little White Bear bravely.
He looked, and it hadn't moved one little
bit, so it seemed as if it couldn't really be
alive! Perhaps it was something that
Omnok had left there. They crept up
toward it, little by little, until they were
right up to it, and what do you think?
It was nothing but Omnok's big whaling
boat he had left on the ice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>They looked all around to see if Omnok
were about, then they tumbled right into
that boat for a frolic. There were a great
many things in the boat, but the most
interesting of all was a great, long "pooksack."
It wasn't full of seal oil. If it
had been, I am quite sure Little Black Bear
would have had nothing to do with it. It
was just full of air. Omnok had used it
for a sled when he drew his boat over the
roof of the ocean. And what a splendid
football it did make, and how they did
knock it about! First Little White Bear
would give it a boost with his big, clumsy
paws, then Little Black Bear would boost
it right over Little White Bear's head!
Then there would be a scramble to see who
would get to it first. But one time Little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Black Bear kicked it right over Little White
Bear's head so high that it tumbled off
the roof of the ocean and down into the
great dark sea. And Little White Bear
tumbled right into the ocean after it!
Yes, sir! Right into the water, and you
never saw water so cold in all your life!
Little White Bear didn't scramble out as
fast as ever he could! He just climbed
up on that "pooksack", happy as a clam,
and wanted Little Black Bear to come in
too! Little Black Bear, however, had a
notion that the water was cold, so he touched
it with his toe and "Um-m-m! Um-m-m!"
he didn't want any swim that day. But
Little White Bear wouldn't come out of the
water and play, so all Little Black Bear
could do was to skip along home and tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
his mother that he was quite sure that Little
White Bear would freeze to death that
very night.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Madam Black Bear,
looking very wise. "Little White Bear
won't freeze to death."</p>

<p>"Why," said Little Black Bear, opening
his eyes wide, "I'm sure I'd freeze right
away."</p>

<p>"So you would," said his mother. "You
were a wise young fellow to try the water
before you ventured in. But Little White
Bear is quite different. He has a very
warm coat and is very fat. He is used to
the cold water and will live in it all winter.
But just you wait," she added, with a sly
wink. "You will have a surprise for him
some day! When he comes to look for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
you some cold, cold time, won't he be surprised
to find you snugly tucked away in
bed and sleeping all day and all night?
Won't he, though?"</p>

<p>Madam Black Bear laughed a big bear
laugh, and Little Black Bear laughed a little
bear laugh, so together they were after all
two of the happiest bears in all the world.</p>

<p>When Omnok went out on the roof of
the sea to get his big boat, he saw what
Little White Bear and Little Black Bear
had done. He was very angry when he
saw that his "pooksack" was gone. He
thought Big White Bear had been there.</p>

<p>"I'll go hunting for him to-morrow morning,"
he said to himself. "And I'll take
Huskie, my Malemute dog, along!"</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>BIG WHITE BEAR MEETS HUSKIE</h3>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Now</span>, I'll tell you," Omnok said to Huskie,
"Big White Bear is a great big bully. He
likes to fight all the little folks of the tundra
and sea because he is so big. It would be
a good thing if we could show him that he
isn't so awfully big, after all. Wouldn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Ki, yi, yiyi," said Huskie, which meant
he thought it would.</p>

<p>"Well, then, this is what you must do.
Go running about on the ocean ice everywhere
and hunt for him. I will be hunting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
too. If you find him first, run away, then
call me. I will shoot him. Do you see?"</p>

<p>"Ki, yiyi," answered Huskie again, meaning
this time, "I do."</p>

<p>Huskie ran up and down, in and out
among the ice piles, until his feet were sore.
He was very anxious to find Big White Bear.
Whenever a little fellow has a chance to
harm a big fellow he thinks is a bully, he
always wants to do it. Did you ever notice
that?</p>

<p>So Huskie ran on and on, even if his feet
were sore.</p>

<p>"Hello!" He had just gone around
something he thought was an ice pile when
he heard a voice.</p>

<p>Looking up, he saw the face of Big White
Bear. What he was going around wasn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
ice at all. It was Big White Bear. And,
my! What a monster he was! Huskie
had to look away off at Cape Prince of Wales
Mountain and look again at Big White
Bear before he could tell which was the larger,
bear or mountain.</p>

<p>He wanted to run away. But Big White
Bear was so very near he didn't dare to,
so he just said "Hello!" But to himself
he said, "Big White Bear is a big, big bully,
just as Omnok said. I am glad he is going
to get killed."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Big White Bear.</p>

<p>"I'm Huskie, the Malemute dog. Who
are you?"</p>

<p>"I am a Polar Bear. Where did you
come from?"</p>

<p>"My home's over there on the shore,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
said Huskie, pointing his nose toward shore.
"Where'd you come from?"</p>

<p>"I came from far, far North. I've never
been here before. Didn't mean to come
this time. Last night I went to sleep on
a corner of Old Ocean's blanket. Old
Ocean put up his knee in his sleep, and my
corner of the blanket slid right down here.
What do you think about that?"</p>

<p>"Very strange."</p>

<p>Now Huskie is a great fighter himself,
for a little fellow. And great fighters like
fight stories. He was just itching to know
all about Big White Bear's big fights.</p>

<p>"Who'd you kill last?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Who did I kill?" said Big White Bear,
opening his eyes very wide.</p>

<p>"Yes, was it a very bad fight?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"A bad fight?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you don't seem much scratched
up for a great fighter. Look at me; one
leg bent, nose split, and scarred up all over,"
said Huskie proudly.</p>

<p>"Do you think I'm a great fighter?"</p>

<p>"Of course you are. Omnok says&mdash;"
Huskie caught himself just in time. If
Big White Bear knew all about Omnok, he'd
run away.</p>

<p>"Why, I never fight anybody," said Big
White Bear gravely.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Huskie. "That's
a good story. You never fight any one.
What a fib!"</p>

<p>"It's the truth."</p>

<p>"The truth? Ha! Ha! Of course that's
not true. You're a bear. All bears are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
fighters, and great big bullies, besides! Why!
I bet you've got claws three inches long."</p>

<p>"You think so?" Big White Bear put
out his front paw which was as big as the
trunk of a small tree. Huskie dodged.</p>

<p>"Look," said Big White Bear.</p>

<p>Huskie looked at Big White Bear's claws.
They were not as long as his own. They
were broad and blunt, just sharp enough
for climbing over the ice.</p>

<p>"I don't know why they name me Bear,"
said Big White Bear; "Old Buster Grizzly,
Buster Brown, and Buster Black, now, are
very distant relatives of mine. Indeed,
they have long claws and are great fighters.
But my nearest relative, Tusks, the Walrus,
is no fighter at all, and believe me, neither
am I."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>But Huskie was a very quarrelsome and
suspicious fellow.</p>

<p>"That will do to tell," said he; "but I
know it is not true. As for those claws of
yours, I can guess how that is. They look
very harmless now. But when you want
to fight, you run them out like a cat's."</p>

<p>"It's no such thing," said Big White Bear.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it is. Omnok says it is. I am
going to tell him now, and he'll fix you!"
Vain boast! Huskie had forgotten himself.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 379px;">
<img src="images/005.jpg" width="379" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"I am going to make your teeth chatter so you
can't call your master." <i>Page <a href="#Page_81">81</a></i></div>

<p>In another instant, before he could dodge,
Big White Bear had grabbed him and hugged
him tight. Huskie could not call out at all.
His voice became the tiniest little squeak.</p>

<p>"Let me go! Let me go!" he squeaked.
"I won't tell! I won't tell! Oh! Oh!
Please, Mr. Bear, let me go!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>But Big White Bear only grinned, and
said "Huh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll not kill you," said Big White
Bear finally. "It's just as I have told you.
I am no fighter. I never hurt anybody,
unless I am driven to do so. I'll not kill
you, but I am going to make your teeth
chatter so you can't call your master."</p>

<p>At that, Big White Bear dropped right
down into the cold, cold water with Huskie
in his arms.</p>

<p>Now Big White Bear lives half the time
in water, and he does not mind it a bit.
But poor Huskie! When Big White Bear
put him back on the ice, he couldn't have
said a word to save his life.</p>

<p>"Now, go and tell your master that you
have seen Big White Bear," said Big White<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Bear, grinning. "But you don't know where
he is just now."</p>

<p>Then he dropped into the water and disappeared.</p>

<p>Huskie did not wait to hunt up his master.
He ran home as fast as he could go.
Try as he might, Omnok has never been
able to get him to go hunting for Big White
Bear again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>LITTLE WHITE FOX GOES HUNTING</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Little White Fox</span> went hunting for Big
White Bear! And he didn't have a gun or
a spear or a bow and arrow! Now what do
you think of that! You see, it was this
way. It was winter time, and food was
becoming very scarce on the hills and the
tundra. All the delicious roots were frozen
hard in the earth, and the berries were all
gone. Little White Fox was very hungry,
and he told Little Mrs. White Fox about it.</p>

<p>"Well," said his mother, "I guess we will
have to go and find a Big White Bear."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Find a Big White Bear!" cried Little
White Fox. "Why, he'd eat us!"</p>

<p>"But you mustn't let him do that," said
Mrs. White Fox.</p>

<p>"But what do we want to find him
for?" said Little White Fox, scratching his
head.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Mrs. White Fox very
mysteriously. "Big White Bear is a very
wasteful fellow. He has a big, big kitchen,
and he has the greatest amount of food
stored there. Oh! piles and piles of it! He
doesn't like to eat his food in his kitchen.
He brings some out every day and always
leaves plenty. Now, if we can find him, we
will just follow him about until his dinner
hour. When he is gone, we will have plenty
to eat. See?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Little White Fox did see and, though he
was half afraid of Big White Bear, he was
also very hungry, and so he was anxious to
go on the hunt right away.</p>

<p>"You go one way, and I'll go the other,"
said Madam White Fox. "When you find
Big White Bear, you come right back to
this rock. I will come back too, and we
will follow him about for weeks and weeks
and have plenty to eat."</p>

<p>Away went Little White Fox, looking,
looking everywhere for Big White Bear!
He looked behind the cliff on the mountain.
But Big White Bear wasn't there. He
looked on the sand bars, but he wasn't
there. He went peering all around the little
lakes, but he wasn't there.</p>

<p>And where do you think Big White Bear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
was? He wasn't in very good business, I
assure you. He was over on the other side
of the mountain. Tusks the Walrus had
just climbed out of the water and had gone
to sleep on the beach close to the mountain.
Tusks was a great, good natured fellow, with
a monstrous, heavy body and a pair of terrible
looking tusks, which were not really
terrible at all, for Tusks never used them
except for digging clams. Big White Bear
was up on the rocks, way, way above Tusks,
and he had a great rock in his powerful
paws, as big a rock as he could lift! He was
going to throw it right down on Tusks and
kill him. He had plenty to eat at home,
but he thought this would be a fine chance
to get some fresh meat.</p>

<p>Just when he was getting ready to throw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
it, something happened. Little White Fox
came round the corner of the hill, looking
here, there, and everywhere for Big White
Bear. He came on round and round till
he was just above Big White Bear, and
then all at once he saw him! He was so
glad he had found Big White Bear, that he
stood right up on his two feet and gave one
big, big laugh, "Ho! Ho! Ha! Ha! Yak!
Yak! Yak!" just like that.</p>

<p>There was never a worse scared bear than
Big White Bear in all the world! He had
a guilty conscience, for he knew it was not
right to throw a rock on poor, tired Tusks,
and when he heard Little White Fox laugh,
he didn't know who it was. It might be
some one very big and dangerous. It might
be Omnok, the hunter, with his terrible gun!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Big White Bear just trembled and trembled,
and the rock fell from his powerful paws
and went splashing into the water without
hurting Tusks at all. But when he looked
around to see who had laughed at him, he
couldn't see any one at all. Little White
Fox knew a whole lot better than to let
Big White Bear see him just then! But
just after that Little White Fox did a very
thoughtless thing. He was so hungry and
wanted so much to see where Big White
Bear had his kitchen, that he forgot all
about his mother telling him to come back
to the big rock, and away he went, after
Big White Bear all by himself.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>BIG WHITE BEAR'S KITCHEN</h3>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I mustn't</span> lose Big White Bear," thought
Little White Fox, "and I mustn't let him
see me. Oh! My! No! I mustn't do that,
for he is a big, big fellow and who knows
what he might do to me?" So he slipped
along behind very slyly, hiding behind this
rock and that one, behind this snow pile
and that one, very carefully indeed.</p>

<p>But Big White Bear was nearly as badly
frightened as Little White Fox. "What
was that great big laugh?" he kept thinking
to himself. And every time he thought
of it, he looked behind him, and I am sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
he really expected to see Omnok, the hunter,
step right out with his terrible gun. But
by and by, when he had gone down the mountain
and across the tundra and over the
little lakes, he was not so much afraid, and
he began to grow hungry. Now that was
just what Little White Fox hoped would
happen, for he was very hungry himself
and very curious besides to see where Big
White Bear kept his pantry. Where would
it be? Would it be in the tall mountains,
or on the tundra, or out on the roof of the
sea? How interesting it would be to know!</p>

<p>Pretty soon Big White Bear began to go
straight ahead, without turning to one
side or the other. Then Little White Fox
was sure he had started for his kitchen, and
he was glad as could be! Big White Bear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
went right out on the roof to the ocean and
on and on and on, till Little White Fox was
good and tired. When he came to the dark,
dark waters of the ocean, Big White Bear
didn't stop one moment. He just tumbled
right into the water and disappeared all
at once!</p>

<p>"My!" said Little White Fox, opening
his eyes very wide. "He will surely
be drowned." And then all at once he
thought of the fine dinner he had been expecting
to get and how far it was back to
the great rock where his mother was to wait
for him. And then, of course, he remembered
what his mother had said about
coming back to call her. How sorry he was
now that he had forgotten all about that.
Oh! if they could only find Big White Bear's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
kitchen! Just then Little White Fox heard
a scratching on the ice and bounded behind
an ice boulder before he was seen. Big
White Bear had come right up out of the
ocean with the biggest dinner you have ever
seen. His kitchen was right down in the
water under the roof of the ocean, and he
had brought his dinner out on the ice to eat
it in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Little White Fox thought Big White Bear
would never, never get through eating, but
he finally did. And there was quite a big
dinner left for Little White Fox. When
Big White Bear was fast asleep on the ice,
taking his after-dinner nap, Little White
Fox crept up and began to eat his dinner
too. "He didn't ask me," said Little White
Fox, "but then I didn't give him a chance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
I am sure he would if I had." It was a very
good dinner and how Little White Fox's
sides did stick out when he had finished!
But he didn't stay to say thank you, so I
guess he wasn't very sure that Big White
Bear would have invited him. He just hid
behind an ice boulder and waited for Big
White Bear to wake up. He mustn't lose
Big White Bear. He began to think about
that fine dinner he had just eaten and about
how he had found Big White Bear all by
himself and how he had frightened him.
It made him feel so good he just wanted to
laugh. The more he thought, the more he
wanted to laugh, and the first thing, before
he knew it, he was laughing right out loud,
"Ha! Ha! Yak! Yak! Yak! Yak!"</p>

<p>Just that minute Big White Bear woke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
up, and he didn't stop to see who was laughing!
He tumbled right into the ocean and
went paddling away as fast as ever he could.
He didn't stop till he was almost out of sight,
then he looked back once for just a moment
and went paddling on and on, till he was
way out of sight. Little White Fox had
lost Big White Bear. All the fine dinners
he was to have in the future were lost, just
because he had laughed at the wrong time.</p>

<p>I don't know what Little Mrs. White
Fox had to say to him when he came home,
for I wasn't there, but there are some very
fine switches made out of reindeer moss lying
all over the tundra. However, Little White
Fox was a very young fellow and had a
great many things to learn, so perhaps his
mother did not punish him very hard.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>BIG WHITE BEAR FINDS LITTLE WHITE
FOX</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Omnok returned from hunting Big
White Bear he sat down and began to think.
"White bears about," he thought to himself.
"There must be white foxes about too, for
they always stay close to white bears. I
must go out and set some traps." And that
is just what he did the very next evening.
He threw the cruel looking traps, with their
ugly steel jaws, over his shoulder and went
out to look for a good place to set them.
At last he came to a place where there were
many white bear tracks. "I guess this will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
do," he said to himself. He took out his
great knife and cut out a cake of snow that
was nearly as hard as ice. He cut this
up into four little snow boards, very square
and very smooth. Then he made a little
hole in the snow and put a trap there.
Next he made a thin shingle of snow,&mdash;so
thin that the least touch would break it
right in two. He put this over the trap
and smoothed it over so carefully that no
one in all the world could tell there was a
trap hidden there. Then he made a little
house over it with the four boards,&mdash;a very
fine looking house with a roof and three sides,
and with one side left open for the door. He
put some nice pieces of meat inside of the
house, so when any little fox came to live
there he wouldn't have to go away hungry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Finally he spilled a few drops of delicious
smelling seal oil around the house and went
away.</p>

<p>Now who should happen by that way,
almost right away, but our own Little White
Fox, looking, looking everywhere for Big
White Bear. Right away the west wind
blew a little whiff of the rich seal oil in front
of his nose, and almost before he knew it,
Little White Fox was standing in front of
the little house that Omnok built, wondering
how it came there and how there happened
to be such delicious looking meat
inside of it. He wasn't quite sure it was
safe to go inside, so he just licked up all the
drops of seal oil around the outside. It
was very good, but it was only a taste, and
it made him hungrier than ever.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"I just believe I am going to have that
meat!" he said to himself. He was about
to put his paw on the little snow shingle
that was so thin and would break so easily,
when he heard a great, gruff voice right
behind him.</p>

<p>"Here! What you doing there?" Little
White Fox just tumbled a back somersault
away from the little house and ran as fast
as ever he could, for there, right behind him,
was Big White Bear! It's one thing to be
looking for some one very much larger than
yourself, but quite another thing for that
big person to be looking at you. Little
White Fox didn't take any chances. But
when he was a long distance away, and Big
White Bear wasn't following him, he turned
around to see what would happen to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
little house. He wished Big White Bear
would go away, so he could get all that
delicious meat.</p>

<p>But Big White Bear did not go away. He
bent his long neck and put his great nose
right up to the little house and gave a great
"Woof!" The little house was far too
small for Big White Bear to enter, so he
put out one of his ponderous, powerful paws
and sent the little house flying every way.
But his ponderous, powerful paw went too
deep. It touched the thin shingle, and
Snap! the trap came down on Big White
Bear's paw. Came down hard too!
Ow-e-e-e! How it did hurt! How Big
White Bear roared! One might have
thought he was being killed! He ran limping
to the ocean, dragging the little fox<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
trap after him. When he got there, he
stuck his paw up in the air, and moved it
round and round, round and round, till
the chain on the trap went Ziz! Ziz! Ziz!
just like that. All of a sudden the trap
came loose and tumbled into the sea, and I
think Steadfast Starfish's children are playing
with it still.</p>

<p>Little White Fox ran straight home to
tell his mother how he had found Big White
Bear and all the things that had happened.</p>

<p>"Well," said his mother, "I think Big
White Bear has found you, and I am sure
it is a good thing he did!" Then she sat
down and told Little White Fox all about
the dangers of nice smelling meat and the
little houses that Omnok builds.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>LITTLE WHITE FOX GOES FISHING</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Little White Fox</span> was hungry again.
It would seem that a little white fox is hungry
most of the time. He went wandering all
over the tundra, looking for something to
eat. At last he came to the bank of the
river. He was sniffing about there when he
spied a door right in the ground near the
ice roof of the river. "Hello!" said he,
stopping short, "I wonder who made that
door in there." He looked into the door
but could see no one. It was too dark.
He shouted into the door, but no one answered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
He crept part way down the stairway.
Then he stopped and listened. He
heard nothing, so he ventured on, and almost
before he knew it, he found himself
in one of the biggest caves he had ever
seen. It was as wide as half the river and
as long as he could see in each direction.
It had an ice roof and a good solid floor.
Only the floor stopped pretty soon, and
then there was water.</p>

<p>"I don't believe anybody in the world
could build a house like this!" said Little
White Fox. "I guess it just happened to be
here, and some one has discovered it. I
wonder who it could be?"</p>

<p>He walked down close to where the water
was, and there he found tracks. Oh! hundreds
and hundreds of them! But he could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
not tell whose tracks they were. He had
never seen such tracks before.</p>

<p>"Anyway, I believe there is something
good to eat in that water," he said to himself.
"If there wasn't, that fellow wouldn't
come down here and stand around so much.
It is nice and warm down here out of the
wind, and I guess I'll stand around a little
myself and see what will happen."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, down below in the river,
two of the little river people were having a
talk all by themselves. They were Unfortunate
Flounder and Mr. Salmon Trout.
Salmon Trout is a very graceful fellow who
always holds himself erect in the water.
When he swims, he goes so swiftly that you
can hardly see him. But Unfortunate Flounder
goes floating around on one side all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
time, and looks more like a dead leaf than
any member of the fish family.</p>

<p>"Why do you not stand straight up in the
water as I do?" said Salmon Trout.</p>

<p>"Well," said Unfortunate Flounder, "it's
only a little my fault. Can't you see that
my eyes are on one of my flat sides and my
stomach on the other? It wouldn't be
very pleasant to go about looking one way
and going another, would it? When I was
going south, I'd be looking west; don't you
see?"</p>

<p>"How does it happen that you are that
way?"</p>

<p>"I was born that way. All my children
are the same, and so were my parents before
me. You see, it's really a matter of ancestry.
Way back somewhere, one of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
great grandparents found out it was easier
to lop around sidewise in the water than
to stand straight up as you do, so he lopped
around all his life long. His son followed
his example and lopped around a little worse.
So it went on, until to-day we could not
straighten up if we were to try. At least,
it would take whole generations before we
could balance ourselves as well as you do.
As for me, I don't see as it matters much,
for, after all, I quite agree with my great
grandfather that it is best to be comfortable,
even if it does make you ugly, ungraceful,
and slow."</p>

<p>But just then Unfortunate Flounder
learned what an unhappy thing it was to
be slow. Little White Fox from his station
on the bank had been watching, watching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
very sharply two dark spots that had
appeared in the water. He had watched
them come closer and closer. At last he
thought he could reach out and grab one
of them without getting in the water.</p>

<p>"Look out!" cried Salmon Trout, as he
glided swiftly away. But poor Unfortunate
Flounder was too slow, and he felt Little
White Fox's sharp teeth close down on him.</p>

<p>Just then something happened. "Here!
what are you doing in my fishing house?"
demanded an angry voice. It frightened
Little White Fox so badly that he dropped
Unfortunate Flounder back into the river
and looked around.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Golden Marten, and this was
his fishing house. At least, he called it his,
for he had made the stairway down to it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
It took Little White Fox only a moment
to discover that while Golden Marten was
not quite as large as he was, his teeth were
very sharp. The door to the stairway was
quite close to him, and before Golden Marten
could stop him Little White Fox was out
of the door and racing for home as fast as
his little legs could carry him.</p>

<p>"All the same," he said to his mother
that night, after he had told her of the cave,
"when I am as old as you are, I am going to
have a fish house all my own!"</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>LITTLE BROWN SEAL'S NARROW ESCAPE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day Little White Fox was out in
front of his house sunning himself. He and
his mother were living off the bounty of
Big White Bear these days, so there was
nothing to worry about. He just stretched
himself out there on the white snow and
looked away at the wide, white world, as
contented as could be. But all at once he
saw a strange, strange thing. Out on the
roof of the silent sea, Little Brown Seal
was sunning himself too, right close to the
door of his home. He was taking little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
"cat" naps. You see, Little Brown Seal
could not sleep down in his house in the
ocean. It was far too damp down there.
So he was lying there by his door, sleeping
just two or three minutes at a time, then
looking up to see if there was any danger
near.</p>

<p>Now that wasn't such a strange thing.
Little White Fox had seen Little Brown
Seal do that nearly every day, but the
strange thing was that there was some one
else out on the ice who seemed to be doing
the very same thing that Little Brown
Seal was doing,&mdash;taking "cat" naps. And
stranger still, he did not seem to be one
of Little Brown Seal's relatives! He was
too long, and he didn't wiggle his body
right!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Little White Fox could see all that, but
Little Brown Seal was so low down on the
ice that all he could see was the stranger's
head. He might have known even then
that it was not one of his cousins, if he had
had as sharp eyes as Little White Fox. But
he didn't, for his eyes were very poor. So
Little Brown Seal thought it was one of
his own cousins taking a nap now and then,
just as he was. Once it looked to Little
White Fox as if he were beginning to understand
that the stranger was not one of his
cousins, for he stayed awake a long, long
time and looked and looked and looked.
The stranger seemed to be sleeping a long
time, and that made Little Brown Seal
suspicious. But just then the stranger
bobbed his head and looked all around this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
way and that way, just as any real, wise
seal would do, and Little Brown Seal decided
it was all right, that this stranger was one
of his really truly cousins.</p>

<p>And who do you think the stranger, who
acted so very much like a seal, was? It
was Omnok, the hunter, with his terrible
gun sliding right along beside him! He
had learned how Little Brown Seal took his
"cat" naps, and he was going to slip right
up to him and kill him. He kept creeping
up closer, closer, closer. But Little Brown
Seal had made up his mind that it was one
of his cousins, and so he didn't ask himself
any more questions about it. He just kept
on taking his little "cat" naps and waking
up to look all around, this way and that
way, but never paying any attention to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
this stranger who was coming nearer all
the time.</p>

<p>"My," Little White Fox thought to himself,
"he will surely be killed. Yes, sir!
I am very, very sure Little Brown Seal is
going to be killed!"</p>

<p>But just when Omnok was getting very
close, and just before he was going to raise
his terrible gun and kill Little Brown Seal,
a strange thing happened. I don't know
how it happened. Perhaps Little White
Fox was sorry the sun was going down so
soon that day, or perhaps he was lonesome
for his mother. Perhaps he was sorry for
Little Brown Seal, because he was going
to get killed in just another minute; but
whatever it was, Little White Fox began to
feel bad all at once. He wanted to cry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and he <i>did</i> cry! He lifted his pink little
nose into the air and cried, "Ah! Ah! Ah!
Yak! Yak! Yak!"</p>

<p>Now Little Brown Seal may not have
very good eyes, but he has very good ears,
and he had just wakened from a "cat"
nap when he heard that lonesome wail
from Little White Fox. And he didn't
wait one minute, nor one second! He
tumbled down into his house in the ocean
as quick as a wink, just as Omnok the
hunter was getting ready to shoot him!</p>

<p>Perhaps you think Omnok wasn't angry!
But he had heard Little White Fox cry. He
would get Little White Fox's coat. Then
he would be even. But Little White Fox
was nowhere about when Omnok climbed
the hill. No, you may be sure he wasn't!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
He was way under the great rock in his own
little home, where Omnok couldn't get near
him. So all Omnok could do was to put his
terrible gun over his shoulder and go back
home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>A STRANGE JOURNEY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Little White Fox</span> went on a strange
journey one day, and when he arrived at its
end, he didn't know where he was! You
see, he had been living for a long time with
his mother off the bounty of Big White
Bear. Now the snow had almost all gone
from the mountains and the tundra. Little
Mrs. White Fox had gone over to the land
and told Little White Fox to watch sharp
and see if Big White Bear came up out of
his kitchen and left anything for them to
eat. She was going over to see if she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
could find any perfectly good blueberries
which had been hidden all winter under
the snow.</p>

<p>Little White Fox loitered about on the
roof to the ocean and dreamed, as little folks
will in the springtime. The weather was
fine, and the sun was shining now, all day
and all night. A great deal of the roof to
the ocean had floated mysteriously away,
one night, but there was a great deal of it
left, and Little White Fox felt very safe.
But all of a sudden, Scratch! Scratch! he
heard Big White Bear come up out of his
kitchen. Then he knew that there was
going to be a feast, just as there had been so
many times before. He waited and waited
until Swish, Swish he heard Big White Bear
tumble back into the water and swim away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Then such a feast as he did have! Well,
Little White Fox ate so much and the sun
shone so brightly, that he began to feel
very, very sleepy, and almost before he
knew anything about it, he was curled up
on the roof to the ocean fast asleep, dreaming
as hard as ever a white fox dreamed.</p>

<p>I don't know how long Little White Fox
slept; hours and hours I imagine. But
when he awoke and looked about him, all
he could see was the dark, deep ocean everywhere.
He jumped to his feet and peered
this side of him and that side, but it was all
the same dark, deep water. There was
nothing but ocean everywhere. The big
waves had come along and carried off the
part of the roof to the ocean that Little
White Fox was sleeping on!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>What was Little White Fox to do? He
could not swim very far, and it was a long
way to land; in fact, he could not see any
land at all. Besides, the water was very,
very cold. He couldn't think of a thing
to do. He just curled up in a heap and
shivered and shivered and shivered, he was
so lonesome and frightened.</p>

<p>"Hello!" shouted Tusks the Walrus, sticking
his head out of the water. He looked
and looked. "That's strange," he said to
himself. "I thought I saw Little White Fox
over here on a piece of the ocean's roof.
Guess not, though. I don't see him now."
And away he swam for a frolic with one of
his cousins.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/006.jpg" width="381" height="500" alt="" title="" />
Big White Bear popped right up out of the
ocean! <i>Page <a href="#Page_119">119</a></i></div>

<p>"Hello!" cried Little Brown Seal, turning
a somersault in the water. When he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
turned the somersault, he looked at the
piece of the ocean's roof. "My! My!"
he sighed. "These eyes of mine must be
getting very bad indeed! I thought I saw
Little White Fox on that piece of roof."
And he too went paddling away to play.</p>

<p>And all the time Little White Fox was
hiding his nose in a little snow bank, and
closing his pink eyes because he was so very
much afraid of every one, even his best
friends, out here on the silent, lonesome sea.
Very soon he was nearly frightened to death.
Big White Bear popped right up out of the
ocean! He climbed up on one end of the
piece of roof and tipped it up so Little White
Fox thought he would surely be tipped into
the sea. But he dug in his toes and hid
his nose, and closed his eyes very tight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Pretty soon Big White Bear thought of
something he wanted to do and tumbled
back into the sea.</p>

<p>Little White Fox floated on and on, for
hours and hours and hours, over the silent
sea. But by and by when he was very,
very hungry and very sure that he would
never see his dear home and his dear mother
again, there came a dreadful storm. Little
White Fox had to dig his toe nails in
tight, again, and once the piece of the roof
broke right in two and nearly threw him
into the sea! But finally he felt a bump.
His piece of roof had struck something hard.
Bump! Bump! He nearly stood on his
head, and in a minute the piece of roof
was perfectly still. Little White Fox looked
up, and right by the piece of roof was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
finest sandy beach you ever saw. He gave
one big run and jumped on the beach, and
scampered away, as fast as ever he could,
just before a big wave came and carried the
piece of roof back to sea.</p>

<p>It wasn't any time at all until he was up
on the edge of the finest hill, eating the
richest, juiciest blueberries that had ever
been kept under a snow bank all the long
winter through. And pretty soon he was
all dry, and feeling fine and not hungry at
all.</p>

<p>"But where in the world am I?" thought
Little White Fox, scratching his head.
"I'll have to see if I can find some of my
friends who can tell me how to go home.
It must be a long, long way."</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>LITTLE WHITE FOX COMES HOME</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Little White Fox looked all around
him very carefully, this way and that, and
didn't see a thing he had ever seen before
and not a person who knew him in all this
new tundra and all these new hills, he felt
very blue, you may be sure. But he didn't
cry about it. He was too happy at being
off that bit of roof to the great ocean for
that. So he looked as far as he could see in
every direction, and at last he spied some
little lakes way down on the tundra. "I'll
just go over there and see if there is any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
one I know," he said to himself, and went
trotting away as fast as ever he could. He
came right down by the lakes and at last
he saw some one he had met in his own home
land. It was Mr. Widgeon Junior, a son of
Old Mrs. Widgeon Duck, who was killed by
Omnok the hunter.</p>

<p>"Hello," said Little White Fox.</p>

<p>Widgeon Junior looked up quick, in a
frightened sort of way, but he never said a
word. He just stretched out his long neck
and flapped his strong wings and began
to fly. And all the time he pointed with
his bill straight ahead and with his feet
straight behind, as if to say, "Follow me;
this is the way home."</p>

<p>"I just believe that <i>is</i> the way home!"
said Little White Fox. "His mother had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
her nest right down on our tundra last
summer, and I believe he is going there
right now!" So he picked up his feet lively
and ran along behind Widgeon Junior but
he couldn't near keep up! It wasn't any
time at all before he was so far behind that he
couldn't see Widgeon Junior at all! And
before long he was just as badly lost as
before. But he trotted on cheerfully, "For,"
he said to himself, "I'll see some one else
I know very soon."</p>

<p>And sure enough, all of a sudden there
was a clap, clap of wings, and some one that
looked just like Who-Who, the big white
owl, went soaring over his head. But when
Little White Fox shouted "Hello" in his
very best voice, the great white owl never
answered a word, but went flapping on till<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
he lit on the top of a whalebone which one
of Omnok's relatives had put up to mark
a grave.</p>

<p>"Well," said Little White Fox to himself,
"I guess that isn't Who-Who, but anyway,
it is one of his cousins, and he is very wise.
All the Owl folks are. He will tell me the
way home."</p>

<p>So he hurried over to the foot of the whalebone
and said, "Please, Mr. White Owl,
won't you tell me the way home?"</p>

<p>The big white owl never answered a word,
but he winked his eye very cunningly, as
much as to say, "Look, I'll show you."
Then he flapped his great, white wings, and
away he flew, and away after him, as fast
as ever he could trot, came Little White
Fox, never once looking this way or that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
to see where he was going, so proud was he
to be able almost to keep up with this new
friend. He ran and ran and ran until he
was out of breath, when he saw the big,
white owl spread his wings out straight and
light on a whalebone sticking right out of
the ground and looking for all the world
like the one he had flown away from just
a little while before. Little White Fox
ran up to the whalebone and looked up at
the big white owl.</p>

<p>The big white owl closed one eye and
winked very knowingly as if to say, "Am
I not a very wise old owl?"</p>

<p>Little White Fox looked all around at
the tundra and the hills, and sure enough,
that was the very same whalebone, sticking
up out of the ground! The big white owl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
had led him a long way, all around in a
circle! You may be sure Little White
Fox was disgusted. He would never ask
another thing of a big white owl again, if he
lived a thousand years! But away he
trotted toward some other little ponds he
had seen some time before.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/007.jpg" width="381" height="500" alt="" title="" />
She was going back to his own dear beach.
<i>Page <a href="#Page_128">128</a></i></div>

<p>He was slipping along as quietly as he
could in the grass when he heard a splash,
splash in the water, and there was Mrs.
Swan. Of all the people in all the world,
besides his own dear mother, Little White
Fox liked Mrs. Swan best! Her white
gown was always so smooth and tidy, her
neck so graceful, and she seemed so kind,
that Little White Fox thought she was
just the most perfect lady that ever was!
To be sure he had been tempted once to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
steal one of the big eggs out of her great
nest, on the beach the summer before, but
he hadn't done it, and now, you may be very
sure, he was glad he hadn't, for perhaps
she would tell him the way home.</p>

<p>"Please, Mrs. Swan," he said, making
a very graceful bow, "will you tell me the
way home?" Mrs. Swan looked at him very
kindly but never said a word. Very soon she
flapped her great, white wings, and putting
her bill right out before her and her feet
straight behind, out she went flapping away to
the northward. Then Little White Fox knew
that was the way home, for she was going
back to his own dear beach to make a new nest
and to hatch out some more little Swanfolks.</p>

<p>I wish I had time to tell you of all the
adventures that befell Little White Fox<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
on his way home, but I haven't. Perhaps
some other time we will hear all about that.
But one day, when the sun was shining
brightly and the flowers were beginning to
bloom, who should little Mrs. White Fox
see come trotting up the path by the big
rock but her own long-lost son, Little White
Fox. And you may well believe that she
was glad to see him! She had thought she
would never see him again. And the things
he had to tell her! How she did listen, and
how the other little Foxes, Violet Blue Fox
and Little Cross Fox and the Silver Fox
twins and all the rest, how they listened!
Oh, Little White Fox was quite a person
in his family that evening! But when he
had been given a good dinner with a piece
of blueberry pie such as only Little Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
White Fox can make, and had curled himself
up on the moss cot by the side of the
great rock, he went to sleep thinking that
after all there was no place in all the world
like his own home under the big rock, and
no one in all the world quite so good as his
own mother; and he felt very, very sure
that he would be careful in the future and
not let anything carry him away from her.</p>
